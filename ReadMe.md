# MarGhen Desktop Layout project
![ Design Preview ](./imgs/marghen-desktop1.png)

## Welcome! 
Thank you for checking out my project!

## The challenge: 
The challenge was to create a landing page with 3 cards presenting the projects of the author. 
The users should be able to:
 
 See hover states for interactive elements.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

```css
.one:hover {
  transform: scale(1.1);
}
```

```css
.one {
    filter: grayscale (100%);
}

```

```css
.example {
transition: transform linear 0.4s, opacity linear 0.4s;
    cursor: pointer;
}
```

### Continued development
In the future a nav bar can be added which will help the users to navigate the website for more information. Also an album with a bigger range of pictures can be provided for every project so that the customers can view the project from different angles.
